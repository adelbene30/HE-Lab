# HE-Lab
Data sets of electron/positron and muon/anti-muon collisions were provided consisting of 100,000 interactions each. The data used was a selection of data recorded by the CMS collaboration in 2010. Quantities had to be read in, checked if they would result in error, and converted to invariant mass, using the necessary equations, for analysis.

Analysis was done using NumPy, matplotlib, and SciPy to plot and model the data. The plots made consisted of binned histograms that were trimmed and zoomed in for final analysis. Between both sets of data, 4 parent particles were successfully identified out of the 4 peaks analyzed.
